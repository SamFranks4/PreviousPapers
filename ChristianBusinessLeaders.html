    <h2>Christian Business Leaders</h2>

    <p><strong>The Christian Business Leader that I found to be an inspiration enough to me was John D. Rockefeller. Although John D. Rockefeller was born in 1839 a lot of his practices are still prevalent today. Mainly because of how large his business operations happened to be. I mean they would obviously have to be of such great economic value given the fact that his net worth is stated to have been $24.7 billion with adjusting for inflation according to <a href="http://helloleads.io">helloleads.io</a>. He began to really make a fortune in the early 1860’s when he realized there was so much money to be made in the oil mining business. According to <a href="http://helloleads.io">helloleads.io</a> he first saw those financial possibilities of rising oil production in Pennsylvania, but then decided to build his first oil refinery near Cleveland. And reportedly it only took two years for that oil refinery to become the largest in the area within only two years.</strong></p>

    <p>This start of entrepreneurship to me is something that I found to be inspiring and a large part of the reason that I chose to dedicate the time to writing this paper about Mr. Rockefeller. According to many sources oil mining/drilling really began to take off in the late 1850’s which would make a Rockefeller a revolutionist in the field. And being a revolutionist at such a scale can only happen to maybe a couple of people every generation. And we were blessed to have one of those people be a person like Rockefeller, more so a Christ follower like Rockefeller. Because of his faith he was a very charitable person, which is something you don’t see in every billionaire today, so you really have to appreciate those kind of people when they come by. According to <a href="http://rockarch.org">rockarch.org</a> in his lifetime he donated anywhere between $530 and $540 million in his lifetime. One thing that was very important to him though was that the money was going to the right places, and that every single dollar donated was used to the furthest extent of its value. <a href="http://rockarch.org">rockarch.org</a> states “the GEB distributed $325 million to improve education at all levels, with emphasis upon higher education”. And in a time like this it wouldn’t be considered uncommon for charitable donations to only go to “White Schools”, but the GEB (General Education Board) donated to help both white and black students.</p>

    <p>But Rockefeller wasn’t just a charitable person who claimed to be a Christian, but he was actually a practicing member at Erie Street Baptist Church, according to <a href="http://rockarch.org">rockarch.org</a>. Which when you have such a high net worth you also gain a lot of responsibilities, but still taking the time out of your day to go to church means so much more than just an ordinary person with nothing to do on a Sunday morning going to church.</p>

    <p>As a business leader he practiced his faith in many ways as well, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/23/10-key-management-principles-from-americas-orginal-richest-person.html">cnbc.com</a> states that there were 10 principles that Rockefeller closely followed as a business leader, and all of them being standard business practices. But two of them stood out to me the most and told me the most about his character. The first of which was to delegate tasks and the second was to respect your employees. I personally believe that these two truly go hand in hand with one another. Because without respect for your employees you would never trust them with important tasks thus you would never have the option to delegate. But more emphasis on respecting your employees because I truly believe that this is something that few business owners and entrepreneurs do at this level. This respect that Rockefeller had for his employees most likely provided them with livable wages, and as good working conditions as there can be for people working in the oil mines.</p>

    <p>But when looking at billionaires as a business major, I shouldn’t just be writing out these things he did I should be learning what to do if I was in a similar situation. I believe that his belief in delegating tasks is what makes businesses succeed. But with that comes the challenge of finding the right employees. The employees who know not to make decisions now that would benefit the short term and damage the long term capabilities of the company. But when finding high-ranking individuals I should also look for people with good morale values. Not necessarily just Christians but people who want to see the best in the world, and see the best in their coworkers and employees underneath them. I think in class we referred to these people as someone who follows McGregor’s Theory Y instead of the alternative Theory X. These people will inherently have more trust in their employees, but that doesn’t mean that they will be overly trusting and put you in those harsh situations. Another one of Rockefeller’s principles was to create unity in the workplace. Which is something that I believe is much easier said than done, because getting people from different backgrounds, cultures, and skintones to put aside their differences to unite for one common goal is tough to do. It’s not like we have that Japanese culture where people take so much pride in their job. But if I were to be in this position that would be my unrealistic goal, in other words I would make it my goal to create a work environment in which the employees had a very distinguished level of respect. To the level that employees took pride in working at the company. I think the best way to achieve those goals would start with a livable wage, but then come with other benefits such as free lunch, etc. But I think what would gain the most trust would be letting them choose working conditions that they favor. Once I build a strong work environment then business can take off, because more satisfied employees means more productive employees.</p>
