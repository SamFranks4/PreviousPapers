      <p>
        Everyday you will see hundreds if not thousands of narratives in the media. They are being presented to you whether you like it or not, some of them so discrete you wouldn’t have consciously noticed. But time and time again I would see foreigners making jokes about how Americans are so lazy, obese, and crazy in general. For the longest time I would treat this as just another one of the narratives I am being presented with, despite it being presented to me numerous times. Because I made myself believe that sometimes the most delusional ideas are also the loudest ideas, the ones you just can’t get out of your head.
      </p>
      <p>
        I told myself that just as there are crazy Americans there are also crazy foreigners, and that those are the ones that are spreading these false or exaggerated at the very least narratives. And that method was working just fine for me until I actually became friends with a foreigner. And this is the type of friends to hang out everyday for weeks straight. So I knew this guy wasn’t crazy, and when he arrived in America for his foreign exchange student program he told me that he discovered that the narratives being spread in America about America were also being spread in Spain and that they were true. He said he looked around and was surprised by the sheer number of people suffering from obesity.
      </p>
      <p>
        This proposed an idea to me that I couldn’t get out of my head for months. The idea that there is so much obesity surrounding us that we don’t even tend to notice it anymore. Which to me is just crazy that not a community, but an entire country had been blinded to what was sitting right in front of them. So now I felt a heavy obligation to see if what he was saying was actually true, or if he was just playing some sick prank on my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        It turned out to be true, the obesity levels in America were at sickening heights. According to World Obesity, America is the only country to not only be top 15 in men’s obesity rates, but also in female obesity rates that has a population of over 10 million with the exception of Egypt. And as widely known obesity leads to a lot of health setbacks such as death. BMC Medicine states “Four-fifths of all deaths aged 35–74 years in the US attributed to obesity and overweight have either diabetes, chronic kidney disease or CVD”. Although death is the worst possible outcome for the majority of people, surprisingly it isn’t the worst option for all people. Specifically depressed people, who oftentimes are also suffering from obesity. When you see numbers such as 43% of people suffering from depression are also fighting all the health setbacks of obesity, which is according to the Centers For Disease Control And Prevention (CDC). And of those people fighting depression 20% of them are on the lifetime risk of suicide according to dbsalliance.org.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what is truly causing this pandemic of depression, obesity, and suicide watch. It could be a number of things, but if I had to guess the true origin of all of this chaos would be lack of motivation. I came to that conclusion upon not only seeing statistics such as “Veterans have a suicide rate that is a 57.3% higher than that of the non-veteran adult population in the U.S.” from dbsalliance.org. Which to me is screaming that these people have lost that will to live that most people strive for. Because when they served in the military, there wasn’t only no time to dwell on your life and fall down a dark path of depressed thoughts, but at the end of every day you rested your head on that same pillow that you did on the night before, and you sleep well knowing that you accomplished something today that 90% of the world probably didn’t. And truthfully it doesn’t matter what you accomplished, because sometimes the feeling of accomplishment is just enough to drive a person to succeed time and time again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Which is why I wanted to go out and chase that feeling myself to see if my hypothesis was correct or it was just a bunch of crap. So I went home that day and wrote out all of my goals, and then I rewrote them again in order of importance. After I had accomplished that I then grabbed a new piece of paper and wrote out how I am going to accomplish my goals and it became very obvious very quickly. All I needed to do was to start lifting weights, it sounds so simple but to me the task almost seemed to be dawning. Not because I ever had any specific incidents while trying to lift previously, but mainly because this wasn’t the first time that I had tried to take the gym seriously. And my only reconciliation of all of those times was feeling the awkwardness of sitting there between sets. Feeling as if the whole entire gym had their eyes on me and were all laughing about the fact that I am lifting what probably looks to them like featherweight.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I told myself a quote “If you want to accomplish things you have never accomplished, you are going to have to do things you’ve never done.” So I went to that gym that day and although it felt awkward, the entire time I kept going back day after day for the entire week, because when I left the gym that first day I felt a sense of pride. A sense of pride in the fact that I did not do what I wanted to do, but what I needed to do. From there I went day after day until the week was over and felt so motivated that I began to give myself other challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the week was finished I kept my routine until the beginning of basketball season, but more importantly I realised I was right, sometimes to get out of a drought, such as the one that I was previously going through before I started the whole better myself movement, you just need to try something new or do something that when you go to sleep at night you will know that you did something right on that day. And this is probably why depression rates went up by so much during the Covid-19 Pandemic, “The WHO reported a 25% increase in depression and anxiety rates worldwide” according to MDPI. Because when you're locked up in the house all day you not only have nothing to be proud of at the end of the day, but you also have nothing to be excited for at the beginning of the day.
      </p>
      <p>
        But thankfully there are many methods of combating depression, such as “Research findings have confirmed a direct relationship between loneliness and self criticism with depression” according to Aging Psychology. Which means that one of the keys for fighting depression specifically in adults is making friends or finding love, which is quite obviously something that is easier said than done but it also fulfills those two ideas that I proposed to combat depression. Going to sleep proud of what you have accomplished, and waking up excited to do something. Sometimes simple tasks or chores can give you a total sense of fulfillment. If none of these other options seem to work then there are always anti-depressant pills, which according to the International Journal of Risk and Safety in Medicine, increase the quality of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        So maybe all the narratives are all correct, but it doesn’t matter. Because there will always be things that people are at fault for and this is one of the things that America is at fault for, thankfully though there are many programs in the USA trying their best to keep people healthy not only physically but mentally as well. And although it may look like some of those numbers that I presented were astonishingly high, they could just as easily be higher if it wasn’t for the programs that the U.S. has in place to combat these illnesses.
