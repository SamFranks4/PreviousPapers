        A style guide is a set of standards for writing and formatting content. It ensures that everything looks consistent and professional. Following a style guide makes documents easier to read and understand, whether they are research papers, essays, or articles. Style guides can include rules for tone, grammar, fonts, headings, and citations.

      <p>
        When working with AI, style guides are especially important. They help the AI generate content in a way that matches your preferred tone, sentence structure, and formatting. You can instruct the AI to follow the style guide exactly, which ensures consistency across all documents.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if a style guide specifies Times New Roman font, 12-point size, and 1.5 line spacing for research papers, you can tell the AI to produce text that matches these rules. You can also specify paragraph length, tone, or citation style to make the generated content fully compliant.
